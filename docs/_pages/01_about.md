Methods in Ten Minutes (MTM) is an inofficial seminar series in the Department
of Oceanography at Dalhousie University with the purpose of sharing tips and
tricks that make scientific work easier. The presentations are not necessarily
restricted to 10 minutes, but the intention is to keep them short.

If you have a topic you would like to know more about or give a presentation on,
please contact us.
